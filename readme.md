## Project MARVELizer

The MARVELizer is a web app that enables you to search for a Marvel character, view information and Giphys related to the character, and save favorite Giphys. The search feature queries the Marvel API for a characterâ€™s description and a thumbnail, and it uses the character name to query the GIPHY API for the top 25 Giphys related to the character.

User story:
  AS A Marvel enthusiast,
  I WANT to search for information about and GIFs of my favorite characters
  SO THAT I can read about Marvel characters and collect my favorite GIFs. 

Technologies used: 
* Foundation
* APIs (Marvel and Giphy)
* JQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* local storage
* Git and GitHub

This was our first group assignment, and gave the team more experience developing with third-party server-side APIs, as well as significantly more experience developing web apps as a team.

All team members contributed to ideas, researched APIs, contributed to shared screen sessions. Additionally, individual contributions include
* Hayk Mnatsakanyan - Created GitHub repo and handled pull requests, did most of the screen sharing and coding during initial programming sessions, was largely responsible for the search page and API calls, and more.
* Beau Barrier - Did Foundation component/template research and development, created the initial Favorites page, added background images and other visual design improvements.
* Gerome Guevarra - Researched APIs, contributed ideas for general concept, contributed to group programming sessions, etc. 
* Matt Linder - Researched APIs, contributed to concept and design, did Foundation component research and development, created presentation (slides), wrote readme, reworked Favorites page and code to populate it.

Challenges: Foundation components frequently had issues, we were concurrently developing weather dashboard apps (homework), and we had to familiarize ourselves (to a certain extent) with Git workflows related to team development.

Successes: We met the requirements (a working app that queries two APIs), we learned to work better as a team, and we learned from each other and the process.

Directions for Future Development:
* Enable users to remove items from favorites????
* More work on look of web app????
* Enable users to page through multiple pages of returned GIFs????
