## Project MARVELizer

The MARVELizer is a web app that enables the user to search for a Marvel character view information and GIFs related to the character, and save favorite GIFs. The search queries the Marvel API for the characterâ€™s description and a thumbnail, and it then uses the character name to query the GIPHY API for the top 25 GIFs related to the character.

This was our first group assignment, and gave the team more experience developing with third-party server-side APIs, as well as web development and team development in general.

User story:
  AS A Marvel enthusiast,
  I WANT to search for information about and GIFs of my favorite characters
  SO THAT I can read about Marvel characters and collect my favorite GIFs.

Technologies used: 
* Foundation
* APIs (Marvel and Giphy)
* JQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* local storage
* Git and GitHub

Tasks and roles: 
* All - Contributed to ideas, researched APIs, work with Hayk as he shared screen
* Hayk Mnatsakanyan- Created GitHub repo, did most screen sharing and coding during programming sessions, created initial search page, did API code, and more.
* Beau Barrier- Did Foundation component/template research and development, created the initial Favorites page, contributed to group programming sessions.
* Gerome Guevarra - Researched APIs,contributed to ideas for general concept, contributed to group programming sessions, etc. 
* Matt Linder - Researched APIs, contributed to concept and design, did Foundation component research and development, created presentation (slides), wrote readme, contributed to group programming sessions, etc.

Challenges: Foundation components never worked as advertised, and the team had to concurrently working on thier individual weather dashboard apps.

Successes: We met requirements (working app that queries two APIs), we worked well as a team, and welearned from each other and the assignment.

Directions for Future Development:
* Enable users to remove items from favorites????
* More work on look of web app????
